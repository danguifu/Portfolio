#Create a shopping cart for a pet store that allows users to add, remove items and display balance. 
#Include section for advice around pet care and adoption centres

#Plan: 
# Create a dictionaries of different items and prices or one nested dictionary with everything 
#Create a menu on a while loop to give options and then several nested menus for different choices.
#eg. menu 1: browse & buy (then browse, remove, basket & check out), 
#adoption centre information (ask for pet type, county), pet care information (which pet and beneath that what info they need). 
#figure out whether my basket shoudl be a list or a dictionary and also how to edit amounts
# define a function for check out so user can access it from any menu
#Figure out how i can adjust quantity of item - can i display this in a grid with tabulate function?
#Figure out my_basket - might need to nest dictionary and set values -eg. {'product' : <default value>, 'price' : <default value>}. 
#would also need to be able to create a new nested dictionary for each item += (revisit lecture 1pm/2pm sunday 14th Jan)
#use round to make sure we only round to 4 digits
